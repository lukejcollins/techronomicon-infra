# Techronomicon Infrastructure Guide 🏰🔧

Greetings, mystic practitioner! This guide holds the ancient runes and sigils required to conjure the mighty Techronomicon infrastructure in the clouded realms of AWS. We shall harness the art of Terraform and the alchemy of GitHub Actions to breathe life into our creation.

## The Infrastructure Scrolls 📜

Our infrastructure is an arcane construct, woven together through the art of Terraform. Through these incantations, we will summon:

- **ECS**: The Eldritch Container Service, where the Techronomicon Docker apparition shall reside.
- **RDS**: The Relic Database Service, a magical trove where the secrets of our scrolls will be safeguarded.
- **VPC**: A Virtually Protected Cauldron, a bounded space in which our artifacts shall intermingle safely.
- **Other mystic components**: As our journey unfolds, additional artifacts and incantations will be bound within our construct.

## Terraform Incantations 🧙‍♂️

Summon the constructs through the dark art of Terraform.

```sh
# Initiate Terraform's magical energies
terraform init

# Conjure a vision of what is to be created
terraform plan
```

## GitHub Actions Ritual 🌀

In this part of the arcane ritual, we employ the spirits of GitHub Actions to continuously transport our latest incantations into the cloud realm. With every sacred push to our repository, the spirits will carry our work into the ether.


## Heed These Words! ⚠️

This is but the beginning of a grand ritual, and as such, many things may change as we travel deeper into the mystic. Engage in the dark arts with caution and always be ready to adapt your incantations as required.

In clouds and stars,
Techronomicon Infrastructure Guild 🧙‍♂️🔧
